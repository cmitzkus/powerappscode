## Testing

Set the values of `speechLanguage`, `speechKey`, and `speechZone` according the credentials within the component preview.

Setting the value of `working` to "start" will start the recording. Once you stop talking, the value of `working` will automatically be set to "done", and `recognizedText` will be updated.
